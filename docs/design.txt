Overall concept:
- text-based MUD designed with phone usablity from the start

things to include:-
- multiple players in the same world (MMO)
- randomly generated item system
- pay for content access, or pay for cosmetic bonuses, not pay to win. 
- content creators get a cut from the profits of their content. 
- open source - basic game engine, closed source content, open to content contributors only. 
- auction house where host takes a cut
- PvP, because it keeps people playing
- focus on chat - groups / noticeboards, etc. chat keeps the social aspect strong, keeps people coming back
- community moderation - ban cheaters, hackers and spammers. perhaps offer payment with ingame currency or ingame rewards. 
- currency. like d2jsp, a currency used for buying and selling items. 
- ability to look at others, see what items / skills / spells others are using. 
- not much focus on single player storyline or quests, as they are too costly to produce and stop being interesting
  very quickly once you've done them. 
- ability for people to observe the world, or observe others playing pvp. generate some spectator interest. 
  even if all you saw was some text and an HP bar going down, before the guy you hate gets killed, that would still be thrilling
- pvp could even have a penalty for dying. a loss of currency, an ear, items, etc. 
- minimap so you have some visibility of nearby rooms, mobs, players, etc. 
- roguelike (inspiration) ??? 
- enable and encourage teamplay - coop to kill mobs / bosses. 


1. Server handles all connections and data to/from those
for each connection that the server manages, it produces Commands. 

human  --input action--> device (phone / computer / terminal) 
- handled by the client (which will vary depending on device.)
- sends data down an ethernet link to the server (currently TCP)

server :-
- reads data from ports
- processes up the stack 
- produces a command. 
- sends the command to the world to handled

world :-
- manages a collection of stuff that makes up the world
- receives input commands from the server
- applies those commands appropriately to the world/players/users within it. 

stuff managed by the world:
- inanimate objects (items)
- animate objects (players/users, npcs, mobs)
- rooms
